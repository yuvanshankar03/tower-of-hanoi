# tower-of-hanoi
The projects, tower of hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks.the objective of the 
puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod.
# steps to run 
step1: click "make move" button to make a disk to move one rod to another.
step2: click "make move" button until its get finished.
# future improvements
the projects is enchanced with more complexity of time and improving algorithm for computing the shortest path
